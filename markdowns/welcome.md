# Welcome!

In this playground activity, we will be writing code that orders pizza for us.
Before we begin the actual coding, let's quickly summarize the four things that we will need our program to be able to do:
    Know the delivery address
    Know the nearest pizza place
    Give the pizza place an order
    Give the pizza place some $$$
